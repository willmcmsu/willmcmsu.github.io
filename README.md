# Will McNeilly Github Pages Portfolio

## Deployment Link
https://willmcmsu.github.io/

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
uv run python build.py
uv run python serve.py   # opens http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

---

## How to customize this portfolio

### 1. Set up the environment

Install `uv` (if you don't have it):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Preview the demo site

Build the example site and open it locally:

```bash
uv run python build.py
uv run python serve.py
```

`serve.py` will open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser automatically.
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

---

### 3. Create your own content

> **Do not overwrite the example files.** Copy them and edit the copies so
> you always have a working reference to look back at.

#### Step 1 — Create your student profile

```bash
cp content/example_student.yaml content/my_profile.yaml
```

Open `content/my_profile.yaml` and fill in:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Your full name |
| `tagline` | One-line description of your focus (e.g. "Data Scientist \| Healthcare Analytics") |
| `about` | One or more paragraphs about you — supports Markdown (see below) |
| `email` | Your email address (or remove the line to hide it) |
| `linkedin` | Your LinkedIn profile URL *(optional — remove the line to hide it)* |
| `github` | Your GitHub profile URL *(optional — remove the line to hide it)* |

**Writing multi-paragraph `about` text**

The `about` field supports Markdown. Use `|` (literal block) in your YAML so blank lines and formatting are preserved:

```yaml
# Use | to write multiple paragraphs and Markdown formatting
about: |
  First paragraph here. *This text will be italic.*

  Second paragraph here. **This text will be bold.**

# Don't use > — it collapses everything into a single line,
# so blank lines between paragraphs are lost.
```

Then open `portfolio_config.yaml` and change:

```yaml
student_file: content/my_profile.yaml
```

#### Step 2 — Create your project files

```bash
cp content/projects/example_project_1.yaml content/projects/my_project_1.yaml
```

Fill in each field:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Project name |
| `short_summary` | 2–3 sentences for a non-expert (this is the most important field!) |
| `tech_stack` | List of tools / languages used |
| `problem_statement` | The business or research problem you solved |
| `approach` | How you approached the problem |
| `results_impact` | Concrete outcomes — numbers, decisions made, lessons learned |
| `repo_url` | Link to your GitHub repository *(optional — remove the line to hide the button)* |
| `notebook_url` | Link to a specific Jupyter notebook in the repo *(optional — remove the line to hide the button)* |
| `image_path` | Place your image in `static/img/` and write `img/my_image.png` here |

Add each project to `portfolio_config.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  - content/projects/my_project_1.yaml
  - content/projects/my_project_2.yaml
```

Once you have your own projects listed, remove the `example_project_*.yaml` lines.

#### Step 3 — Add your own images

Replace the placeholder images by saving your own image files to `static/img/` and updating `image_path` in the corresponding project YAML. Any common image format (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) will work.

---

### 4. Customize the look and feel

#### Switch theme

In `portfolio_config.yaml`:

```yaml
theme: light    # or: dark, msu-light, msu-dark
```

The following themes are included out of the box:

| Theme name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `light` | Clean light theme (default) |
| `dark` | Dark gray theme |
| `msu-light` | Michigan State University — Spartan Green on white |
| `msu-dark` | Michigan State University — white and Lime Green on deep green |

MSU colors follow the official brand guidelines at [brand.msu.edu/visual/color-palette](https://brand.msu.edu/visual/color-palette).

#### Modify global styles

Edit `static/css/base.css` to change layout, spacing, typography, or any style that should apply to both themes.

#### Create a custom theme

1. Copy an existing theme file:

   ```bash
   cp static/css/themes/light.css static/css/themes/ocean.css
   ```

2. Edit the colors in `ocean.css`.

3. Select it in `portfolio_config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   theme: ocean
   ```

4. Rebuild:

   ```bash
   uv run python build.py
   ```

---

### 5. Publish with GitHub Pages

> **Before you push:** The `docs/` folder is not included in this template repo — you need to generate it first. Run `uv run python build.py` locally and commit the resulting `docs/` folder before enabling GitHub Pages, otherwise GitHub will have nothing to serve.

1. **Remove `docs/` from `.gitignore`.**

   The template's `.gitignore` excludes `docs/` so the example site isn't committed to the template repo itself. In your own fork, you need to track `docs/` so GitHub Pages can serve it. Open `.gitignore` and delete (or comment out) this line:

   ```gitignore
   docs/
   ```

2. **Build the site and commit `docs/`.**

   ```bash
   uv run python build.py
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "build site"
   ```

3. **Push your repo to GitHub.**

4. In your repository on GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.

5. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.

6. Set the branch to `main` (or your default branch) and the folder to `/docs`.

7. Click **Save**. GitHub will build and publish your site within a minute or two.

Your site will be available at:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
```

> **Note:** If you name the repository `<your-github-username>.github.io`, GitHub will publish it at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/` (no repo name suffix).

**Already have a personal site at `https://<username>.github.io/`?**

That site lives in a special repo named exactly `<username>.github.io`. As long as you put this portfolio in *any other repo* (e.g. `data-science-portfolio`), GitHub Pages will publish it alongside your existing site at a separate URL — the two sites will not interfere with each other:

| Repo name | Published URL |
| --- | --- |
| `username.github.io` | `https://username.github.io/` ← your existing site, untouched |
| `data-science-portfolio` | `https://username.github.io/data-science-portfolio/` ← this portfolio |

Because this template uses only relative paths for CSS and images, **no code changes are needed** — the site will work correctly whether it is served from the root or from a subdirectory.

---

## Typical iteration workflow

When you're making updates, the typical workflow will be:

1. Edit YAML content files and/or CSS.
2. `uv run python build.py` ← regenerate the site with your changes
3. `uv run python serve.py` ← preview in browser
4. `git add . && git commit -m "update portfolio"` ← commit your changes
5. `git push origin main` ← GitHub Pages auto-deploys

## Files you will edit most

| File | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `portfolio_config.yaml` | Theme (`light`/`dark`/`msu-light`/`msu-dark`), student file, project list, `site_title` (browser tab text) |
| `content/my_profile.yaml` | Your name, tagline, about blurb, contact info |
| `content/projects/my_project_*.yaml` | Individual project descriptions |
| `static/img/` | Your project thumbnail images |
| `static/css/base.css` | Global layout and typography |
| `static/css/themes/light.css` | Light theme colors |
| `static/css/themes/dark.css` | Dark theme colors |

Files you should **not** need to edit unless you want to change the page structure:
- `templates/base.html` — HTML shell (header, nav, footer)
- `templates/index.html` — Page layout and section order
- `build.py` — Site generator
- `serve.py` — Local preview server
